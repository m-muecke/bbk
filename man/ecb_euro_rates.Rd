\details{
Note you can achieve the same by calling the \code{\link[=ecb_data]{ecb_data()}} function with the right
parameters for each currency.

The reference rates are usually updated at around 16:00 CET every working day,
except on \href{https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/contacts/working-hours/html/index.en.html}{TARGET closing days}.

They are based on the daily concertation procedure between central banks across
Europe, which normally takes place around 14:10 CET. The reference rates are
published for information purposes only.
Using the rates for transaction purposes is strongly discouraged.
